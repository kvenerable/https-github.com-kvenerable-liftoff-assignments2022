### Overview

We created an app to boost productivity for those easily  distracted and who may suffer from ADHD. Users will find that this app helps keep one on task with friendly reminders and rewards as tasks are completed using the pomodoro method.. The idea was inspired from personal experiences. Like myself, I tend to be easily distracted, procrastinate or become overwhelmed with my busy schedule. This app provides a perceptible aspect,  instead of  being overwhelmed with todos on pieces of paper or keeping a tally of the many tasks in your head. This turns your boring todo list into something fun and interactive. As tasks are completed you will be able to earn rewards and incentives.  Users will be able to choose from 3 virtual pets based on levels of difficulty. The pets will act as accountability partners to keep you focused. Your accountability pet will have moods that are influenced based on your productivity. When productivity is low, you will notice a not so happy panda, raccoon or wolf.  Our hope is that a visual display will motivate you to earn pumpkins or bamboo to fuel your pets happiness while seeing your task through to completion.
